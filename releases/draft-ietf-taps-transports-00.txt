1.  Introduction

   Most Internet applications make use of the Transport Services
   provided by TCP (a reliable, in-order stream protocol) or UDP (an
   unreliable datagram protocol).  We use the term "Transport Service"
   to mean an end-to-end facility provided by the transport layer.  That
   service can only be provided correctly if information is supplied
   from the application.  The application may determine the information
   to be supplied at design time, compile time, or run time and may
   include guidance on whether an aspect of the service is required, a
   preference by the application, or something in between.  Examples of
   Transport service facilities are reliable delivery, ordered delivery,
   content privacy to in-path devices, integrity protection, and minimal
   latency.

   Transport protocols such as SCTP, DCCP, MPTCP, UDP and UDP-Lite have
   been defined at the transport layer.

   In addition, a transport service may be built on top of these
   transport protocols, using a fraemwork such as WebSockets, or RTP.
   Service built on top of UDP or UDP-Lite typically also need to
   specify a congestion control mechanism, such as TFRC or the LEDBAT
   congestion control mechanism.  This extends the set of available
   Transport Services beyond those provided to applications by TCP and
   UDP.

   Transport services can aslo be differentiated by the services they
   provide: for instance, SCTP offers a message-based service that does
   not suffer head-of-line blocking when used with multiple stream,
   because it can accept blocks of data out of order, UDP-Lite provides
   partial integrity protection when used over link-layer services that
   can support this, and LEDBAT can provide low-priority "scavenger"
   communication.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined throughout this document, and in
   subsequent documents produced by TAPS describing the composition and
   decomposition of transport services.

   The terminology below is that as was presented at the TAPS WG meeting
   in Honolulu.  While the factoring of the terminology seems
   uncontroversial, thre may be some entities which still require names
   (e.g. information about the interface between the transport and lower

   layers which could lead to the availablity or unavailibility of
   certain transport protocol features)

   Transport Service Feature:   a specific feature a transport service
      provides to its clients end-to-end.  Examples include
      confidentiality, reliable delivery, ordered delivery, message-
      versus-stream orientation, etc.

   Transport Service:   a set of transport service features, without an
      association to any given framing protocol, which provides a
      complete service to an application.

   Transport Protocol:   an implementation that provides one or more
      different transport services using a specific framing and header
      format on the wire.

   Transport Protocol Component:   an implementation of a transport
      service feature within a protocol

   Transport Service Instance:   an arrangement of transport protocols
      with a selected set of features and configuration parameters that
      implements a single transport service, e.g. a protocol stack (RTP
      over UDP)

   Application:   an entity that uses the transport layer for end-to-end
      delivery data across the network.

3.  Transport Protocols

   This section provides a list of known IETF transport protocol and
   transport protocol frameworks.

3.1.  Transport Control Protocol (TCP)

   TCP [RFC0793] provides a bidirectional byte-oriented stream over a
   connection- oriented protocol.  The protocol and API use the byte-
   stream model.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Mirja Kuehlewind signed up as contributor for this
   section.]

3.1.1.  Multipath TCP (MPTCP)

3.2.  Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)

   SCTP [RFC4960] provides a bidirectional set of logical unicast
   streams over one a connection-oriented protocol.  The protocol and
   API use messages, rather than a byte-stream.  Each stream of messages

   is independently managed, therefore retransmission does not hold back
   data sent using other logical streams.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Michael Tuexen and Karen Nielsen signed up as
   contributors for these sections.]

3.2.1.  Partial Reliability for SCTP (PR-SCTP)

   PR-SCTP [RFC3758] is a variant of SCTP that provides partial
   reliability.

3.3.  User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

   The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC0768] provides a unidirectional
   minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion
   control mechanisms.  The service may be multicast and/or unicast.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Kevin Fall signed up as contributor for this
   section.]

3.3.1.  UDP-Lite

   A special class of applications can derive benefit from having
   partially-damaged payloads delivered, rather than discarded, when
   using paths that include error-prone links.  Such applications can
   tolerate payload corruption and may choose to use the Lightweight
   User Datagram Protocol [RFC3828].  The service may be multicast and/
   or unicast.

3.4.  Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)

   The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340] is a
   bidirectional transport protocol that provides unicast connections of
   congestion-controlled unreliable messages.  DCCP is suitable for
   applications that transfer fairly large amounts of data and that can
   benefit from control over the tradeoff between timeliness and
   reliability.

3.5.  Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP)

   RTP provides an end-to-end network transport service, suitable for
   applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or
   data, over multicast or unicast network services, including TCP, UDP,
   UDP-Lite, DCCP.

3.6.1.  WebSockets

   [RFC6455]

4.  Transport Service Features

   Features as derived from the subsections above.

   This section is blank for now.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no considerations for IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document surveys existing transport protocols and protocols
   providing transport-like services.  Confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity are among the features provided by those services.  This
   document does not specify any new components or mechanisms for
   providing these features.  Each RFC listed in this document discusses
   the security considerations of the specification it contains.

7.  Contributors

   authors section.
