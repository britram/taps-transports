1.  Introduction

   Most Internet applications make use of the Transport Services
   provided by TCP (a reliable, in-order stream protocol) or UDP (an
   unreliable datagram protocol).  We use the term "Transport Service"
   to mean the end-to-end service provided to an application by the
   transport layer.  That service can only be provided correctly if
   information about the intended usage is supplied from the
   application.  The application may determine this information at
   design time, compile time, or run time, and may include guidance on
   whether a feature is required, a preference by the application, or
   something in between.  Examples of features of Transport Services are
   reliable delivery, ordered delivery, content privacy to in-path
   devices, integrity protection, and minimal latency.

   The IETF has defined a wide variety of transport protocols beyond TCP
   and UDP, including TCP, SCTP, DCCP, MP-TCP, and UDP-Lite.  Transport
   services may be provided directly by these transport protocols, or
   layered on top of them using protocols such as WebSockets (which runs
   over TCP) or RTP (over TCP or UDP).  Services built on top of UDP or
   UDP-Lite typically also need to specify additional mechanisms,
   including a congestion control mechanism (such as a windowed
   congestion control, TFRC or LEDBAT congestion control mechanism).
   This extends the set of available Transport Services beyond those
   provided to applications by TCP and UDP.

   Transport protocols can also be differentiated by the features of the
   services they provide: for instance, SCTP offers a message-based
   service that does not suffer head-of-line blocking when used with
   multiple stream, because it can accept blocks of data out of order,
   UDP-Lite provides partial integrity protection, and LEDBAT can
   provide low-priority "scavenger" communication.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined throughout this document, and in
   subsequent documents produced by TAPS describing the composition and
   decomposition of transport services.

   [NOTE: The terminology below was presented at the TAPS WG meeting in
   Honolulu.  While the factoring of the terminology seems
   uncontroversial, there may be some entities which still require names
   (e.g. information about the interface between the transport and lower
   layers which could lead to the availability or unavailability of

   certain transport protocol features).  Comments are welcome via the
   TAPS mailing list.]

   Transport Service Feature:  a specific end-to-end feature that a
      transport service provides to its clients.  Examples include
      confidentiality, reliable delivery, ordered delivery, message-
      versus-stream orientation, etc.

   Transport Service:  a set of transport service features, without an
      association to any given framing protocol, which provides a
      complete service to an application.

   Transport Protocol:  an implementation that provides one or more
      different transport services using a specific framing and header
      format on the wire.

   Transport Protocol Component:  an implementation of a transport
      service feature within a protocol.

   Transport Service Instance:  an arrangement of transport protocols
      with a selected set of features and configuration parameters that
      implements a single transport service, e.g. a protocol stack (RTP
      over UDP).

   Application:  an entity that uses the transport layer for end-to-end
      delivery data across the network (this may also be an upper layer
      protocol or tunnel encapsulation).

3.  Existing Transport Protocols

   This section provides a list of known IETF transport protocol and
   transport protocol frameworks.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Contributions to the subsections below are welcome]

3.1.  Transport Control Protocol (TCP)

   TCP is an IETF standards track transport protocol.  [RFC0793]
   introduces TCP as follows: "The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   is intended for use as a highly reliable host-to-host protocol
   between hosts in packet-switched computer communication networks, and
   in interconnected systems of such networks."  Since its introduction,
   TCP has become the default connection-oriented, stream-based
   transport protocol in the Internet.  It is widely implemented by
   endpoints and widely used by common applications.

3.1.1.  Protocol Description

   TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, providing a three way
   handshake to allow a client and server to set up a connection, and
   mechanisms for orderly completion and immediate teardown of a
   connection.  TCP is defined by a family of RFCs [RFC4614].

   TCP provides multiplexing to multiple sockets on each host using port
   numbers.  An active TCP session is identified by its four-tuple of
   local and remote IP addresses and local port and remote port numbers.
   The destination port during connection setup has a different role as
   it is often used to indicate the requested service.

   TCP partitions a continuous stream of bytes into segments, sized to
   fit in IP packets.  ICMP-based PathMTU discovery [RFC1191][RFC1981]
   as well as Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) [RFC4821]
   are supported.

   Each byte in the stream is identified by a sequence number.  The
   sequence number is used to order segments on receipt, to identify
   segments in acknowledgments, and to detect unacknowledged segments
   for retransmission.  This is the basis of TCP's reliable, ordered
   delivery of data in a stream.  TCP Selective Acknowledgment [RFC2018]
   extends this mechanism by making it possible to identify missing
   segments more precisely, reducing spurious retransmission.

   Receiver flow control is provided by a sliding window: limiting the
   amount of unacknowledged data that can be outstanding at a given
   time.  The window scale option [RFC7323] allows a receiver to use
   windows greater than 64KB.

   All TCP senders provide Congestion Control: This uses a separate
   window, where each time congestion is detected, this congestion
   window is reduced.  A receiver detects congestion using one of three
   mechanisms: A retransmission timer, detection of loss (interpreted as
   a congestion signal), or Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
   [RFC3168] to provide early signaling (see
   [I-D.ietf-aqm-ecn-benefits])

   A TCP protocol instance can be extended [RFC4614] and tuned.  Some
   features are sender-side only, requiring no negotiation with the
   receiver; some are receiver-side only, some are explicitly negotiated
   during connection setup.

   By default, TCP segment partitioning uses Nagle's algorithm [RFC0896]
   to buffer data at the sender into large segments, potentially
   incurring sender-side buffering delay; this algorithm can be disabled




Fairhurst, et al.        Expires August 31, 2015                [Page 4]

   by the sender to transmit more immediately, e.g. to enable smoother
   interactive sessions.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: add URGENT and PUSH flag (note [RFC6093] says SHOULD
   NOT use due to the range of TCP implementations that process TCP
   urgent indications differently.) ]

   A checksum provides an Integrity Check and is mandatory across the
   entire packet.  The TCP checksum does not support partial corruption
   protection as in DCCP/UDP-Lite).  This check protects from
   misdelivery of data corrupted data, but is relatively weak, and
   applications that require end to end integrity of data are
   recommended to include a stronger integrity check of their payload
   data.

   A TCP service is unicast.

3.1.2.  Interface description

   A User/TCP Interface is defined in [RFC0793] providing six user
   commands: Open, Send, Receive, Close, Status.  This interface does
   not describe configuration of TCP options or parameters beside use of
   the PUSH and URGENT flags.

   In API implementations derived from the BSD Sockets API, TCP sockets
   are created using the "SOCK_STREAM" socket type.

   The features used by a protocol instance may be set and tuned via
   this API.

   (more on the API goes here)

3.1.3.  Transport Protocol Components

   The transport protocol components provided by TCP are:

   o  unicast

   o  connection setup with feature negotiation and application-to-port
      mapping

   o  port multiplexing

   o  reliable delivery

   o  ordered delivery for each byte stream

   o  error detection (checksum)

   o  segmentation

   o  stream-oriented delivery in a single stream

   o  data bundling (Nagle's algorithm)

   o  flow control

   o  congestion control

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: discussion of how to map this to features and TAPS:
   what does the higher layer need to decide? what can the transport
   layer decide based on global settings? what must the transport layer
   decide based on network characteristics?]

3.2.  Multipath TCP (MP-TCP)

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: a few sentences describing Multipath TCP [RFC6824] go
   here.  Note that this adds transport-layer multihoming to the
   components TCP provides]

3.3.  Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)

   SCTP is a message oriented standards track transport protocol and the
   base protocol is specified in [RFC4960].  It supports multi-homing to
   handle path failures.  An SCTP association has multiple
   unidirectional streams in each direction and provides in-sequence
   delivery of user messages only within each stream.  This allows to
   minimize head of line blocking.  SCTP is extensible and the currently
   defined extensions include mechanisms for dynamic re-configurations
   of streams [RFC6525] and IP-addresses [RFC5061].  Furthermore, the
   extension specified in [RFC3758] introduces the concept of partial
   reliability for user messages.

   SCTP was originally developed for transporting telephony signalling
   messages and is deployed in telephony signalling networks, especially
   in mobile telephony networks.  Additionally, it is used in the WebRTC
   framework for data channels and is therefore deployed in all WEB-
   browsers supporting WebRTC.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Michael Tuexen and Karen Nielsen signed up as
   contributors for these sections.]

3.3.1.  Protocol Description

   SCTP is a connection oriented protocol using a four way handshake to
   establish an SCTP association and a three way message exchange to




Fairhurst, et al.        Expires August 31, 2015                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               TAPS Transports               February 2015


   gracefully shut it down.  It uses the same port number concept as
   DCCP, TCP, UDP, and UDP-Lite do and only supports unicast.

   SCTP uses the 32-bit CRC32c for protecting SCTP packets against bit
   errors.  This is stronger than the 16-bit checksums used by TCP or
   UDP.  However, a partial checksum coverage as provided by DCCP or
   UDP-Lite is not supported.

   SCTP has been designed with extensibility in mind.  Each SCTP packet
   starts with a single common header containing the port numbers, a
   verification tag and the CRC32c checksum.  This common header is
   followed by a sequence of chunks.  Each chunk consists of a type
   field, flags, a length field and a value.  [RFC4960] defines how a
   receiver processes chunks with an unknown chunk type.  The support of
   extensions can be negotiated during the SCTP handshake.

   SCTP provides a message-oriented service.  Multiple small user
   messages can be bundled into a single SCTP packet to improve the
   efficiency.  User messages which would result in IP packets larger
   than the MTU will be fragmented at the sender side and reassembled at
   the receiver side.  There is no protocol limit on the user message
   size.  [RFC4821] defines a method to perform packetization layer path
   MTU discovery with probe packets using the padding chunks defined the
   [RFC4820].

   [RFC4960] specifies a TCP friendly congestion control to protect the
   network against overload.  SCTP also uses a sliding window flow
   control to protect receivers against overflow.

   Each SCTP association has between 1 and 65536 uni-directional streams
   in each direction.  The number of streams can be different in each
   direction.  Every user-message is sent on a particular stream.  User
   messages can be sent ordered or un-ordered upon request by the upper
   layer.  Only all ordered messages sent on the same stream are
   delivered at the receiver in the same order as sent by the sender.
   For user messages not requiring fragmentation, this minimises head of
   line blocking.  The base protocol defined in [RFC4960] doesn't allow
   interleaving of user-messages, which results in sending a large
   message on one stream can block the sending of user messages on other
   streams.  [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-ndata] overcomes this limitation and
   also allows to specify a scheduler for the sender side streams
   selection.  The stream re-configuration extension defined in
   [RFC6525] allows to reset streams during the lifetime of an
   association and to increase the number of streams, if the number of
   streams negotiated in the SCTP handshake is not sufficient.

   According to [RFC4960], each user message sent is either delivered to
   the receiver or, in case of excessive retransmissions, the

Internet-Draft               TAPS Transports               February 2015


   association is terminated in a non-graceful way, similar to the TCP
   behaviour.  In addition to this reliable transfer, the partial
   reliability extension defined in [RFC3758] allows the sender to
   abandon user messages.  The application can specify the policy for
   abandoning user messages.  Examples for these policies include:

   o  Limiting the time a user message is dealt with by the sender.

   o  Limiting the number of retransmissions for each fragment of a user
      message.

   o  Abandoning messages of lower priority in case of a send buffer
      shortage.

   SCTP supports multi-homing.  Each SCTP end-point uses a list of IP-
   addresses and a single port number.  These addresses can be any
   mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  These addresses are negotiated
   during the handshake and the address re-configuration extension
   specified in [RFC5061] can be used to change these addresses during
   the livetime of an SCTP association.  This allows for transport layer
   mobility.  Multiple addresses are used for improved resilience.  If a
   remote address becomes unreachable, the traffic is switched over to a
   reachable one, if one exists.  Each SCTP end-point supervises
   continuously the reachability of all peer addresses using a heartbeat
   mechanism.

   For securing user messages, the use of TLS over SCTP has been
   specified in [RFC3436].  However, this solution does not support all
   services provided by SCTP (for example un-ordered delivery or partial
   reliability), and therefore the use of DTLS over SCTP has been
   specified in [RFC6083] to overcome these limitations.  When using
   DTLS over SCTP, the application can use almost all services provided
   by SCTP.

   For legacy NAT traversal, [RFC6951] defines the UDP encapsulation of
   SCTP-packets.  Alternatively, SCTP packets can be encapsulated in
   DTLS packets as specified in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].  The
   latter encapsulation is used with in the WebRTC context.

   Having a well defined API is also a feature provided by SCTP as
   described in the next subsection.

3.3.2.  Interface Description

   [RFC4960] defines an abstract API for the base protocol.  An
   extension to the BSD Sockets API is defined in [RFC6458] and covers:

   o  the base protocol defined in [RFC4960].



Fairhurst, et al.        Expires August 31, 2015                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               TAPS Transports               February 2015


   o  the SCTP Partial Reliability extension defined in [RFC3758].

   o  the SCTP Authentication extension defined in [RFC4895].

   o  the SCTP Dynamic Address Reconfiguration extension defined in
      [RFC5061].

   For the following SCTP protocol extensions the BSD Sockets API
   extension is defined in the document specifying the protocol
   extensions:

   o  the SCTP SACK-IMMEDIATELY extension defined in [RFC7053].

   o  the SCTP Stream Reconfiguration extension defined in [RFC6525].

   o  the UDP Encapsulation of SCTP packets extension defined in
      [RFC6951].

   o  the additional PR-SCTP policies defined in
      [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-prpolicies].

   Future documents describing SCTP protocol extensions are expected to
   describe the corresponding BSD Sockets API extension in a "Socket API
   Considerations" section.

   The SCTP socket API supports two kinds of sockets:

   o  one-to-one style sockets (by using the socket type "SOCK_STREAM").

   o  one-to-many style socket (by using the socket type
      "SOCK_SEQPACKET").

   One-to-one style sockets are similar to TCP sockets, there is a 1:1
   relationship between the sockets and the SCTP associations (except
   for listening sockets).  One-to-many style SCTP sockets are similar
   to unconnected UDP sockets as there is a 1:n relationship between the
   sockets and the SCTP associations.

   The SCTP stack can provide information to the applications about
   state changes of the individual paths and the association whenever
   they occur.  These events are delivered similar to user messages but
   are specifically marked as notifications.

   A couple of new functions have been introduced to support the use of
   multiple local and remote addresses.  Additional SCTP-specific send
   and receive calls have been defined to allow dealing with the SCTP
   specific information without using ancillary data in the form of
   additional cmsgs, which are also defined.  These functions provide

   support for detecting partial delivery of user messages and
   notifications.

   The SCTP socket API allows a fine-grained control of the protocol
   behaviour through an extensive set of socket options.

   The SCTP kernel implementations of FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris follow
   mostly the specified extension to the BSD Sockets API for the base
   protocol and the corresponding supported protocol extensions.

3.3.3.  Transport Protocol Components

   The transport protocol components provided by SCTP are:

   o  unicast

   o  connection setup with feature negotiation and application-to-port
      mapping

   o  port multiplexing

   o  reliable or partially reliable delivery

   o  ordered and unordered delivery within a stream

   o  support for multiple prioritised streams

   o  flow control (slow receiver function)

   o  message-oriented delivery

   o  congestion control

   o  application PDU bundling

   o  application PDU fragmentation and reassembly

   o  integrity check

   o  transport layer multihoming for resilience

   o  transport layer mobility

3.4.  User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

   The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC0768] [RFC2460] is an IETF
   standards track transport protocol.  It provides a uni-directional,
   datagram protocol which preserves message boundaries.  It provides
   none of the following transport features: error correction,
   congestion control, or flow control.  It can be used to send
   broadcast datagrams (IPv4) or multicast datagrams (IPv4 and IPv6), in
   addition to unicast (and anycast) datagrams.  IETF guidance on the
   use of UDP is provided in[RFC5405].  UDP is widely implemented and
   widely used by common applications, especially DNS.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Kevin Fall signed up as a contributor for this
   section.]

3.4.1.  Protocol Description

   UDP is a connection-less protocol which maintains message boundaries,
   with no connection setup or feature negotiation.  The protocol uses
   independent messages, ordinarily called datagrams.  The lack of error
   control and flow control implies messages may be damaged, re-ordered,
   lost, or duplicated in transit.  A receiving application unable to
   run sufficiently fast or frequently may miss messages.  The lack of
   congestion handling implies UDP traffic may cause the loss of
   messages from other protocols (e.g., TCP) when sharing the same
   network paths.  UDP traffic can also cause the loss of other UDP
   traffic in the same or other flows for the same reasons.

   Messages with bit errors are ordinarily detected by an invalid end-
   to-end checksum and are discarded before being delivered to an
   application.  There are some exceptions to this general rule,
   however.  UDP-Lite (see [RFC3828], and below) provides the ability
   for portions of the message contents to be exempt from checksum
   coverage.  It is also possible to create UDP datagrams with no
   checksum, and while this is generally discouraged [RFC1122]
   [RFC5405], certain special cases permit its use [RFC6935].  The
   checksum support considerations for omitting the checksum are defined
   in [RFC6936].  Note that due to the relatively weak form of checksum
   used by UDP, applications that require end to end integrity of data
   are recommended to include a stronger integrity check of their
   payload data.

   On transmission, UDP encapsulates each datagram into an IP packet,
   which may in turn be fragmented by IP.  Applications concerned with
   fragmentation or that have other requirements such as receiver flow
   control, congestion control, PathMTU discovery/PLPMTUD, support for
   ECN, etc need to be provided by protocols other than UDP [RFC5405].

3.4.2.  Interface Description

   [RFC0768] describes basic requirements for an API for UDP.  Guidance
   on use of common APIs is provided in [RFC5405].

   A UDP endpoint consists of a tuple of (IP address, port number).
   Demultiplexing using multiple abstract endpoints (sockets) on the
   same IP address are supported.  The same socket may be used by a
   single server to interact with multiple clients (note: this behavior
   differs from TCP, which uses a pair of tuples to identify a
   connection).  Multiple server instances (processes) binding the same
   socket can cooperate to service multiple clients- the socket
   implementation arranges to not duplicate the same received unicast
   message to multiple server processes.

   Many operating systems also allow a UDP socket to be "connected",
   i.e., to bind a UDP socket to a specific (remote) UDP endpoint.
   Unlike TCP's connect primitive, for UDP, this is only a local
   operation that serves to simplify the local send/receive functions
   and to filter the traffic for the specified addresses and ports
   [RFC5405].

3.4.3.  Transport Protocol Components

   The transport protocol components provided by UDP are:

   o  unidirectional

   o  port multiplexing

   o  2-tuple endpoints

   o  IPv4 broadcast, multicast and anycast

   o  IPv6 multicast and anycast

   o  IPv6 jumbograms

   o  message-oriented delivery

   o  error detection (checksum)

   o  checksum optional

3.5.  Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite)

   The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) [RFC3828] is an
   IETF standards track transport protocol.  UDP-Lite provides a
   bidirectional set of logical unicast or multicast message streams
   over a datagram protocol.  IETF guidance on the use of UDP-Lite is
   provided in [RFC5405].

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Gorry Fairhurst signed up as a contributor for this
   section.]

3.5.1.  Protocol Description

   UDP-Lite is a connection-less datagram protocol, with no connection
   setup or feature negotiation.  The protocol use messages, rather than
   a byte-stream.  Each stream of messages is independently managed,
   therefore retransmission does not hold back data sent using other
   logical streams.

   It provides multiplexing to multiple sockets on each host using port
   numbers.  An active UDP-Lite session is identified by its four-tuple
   of local and remote IP addresses and local port and remote port
   numbers.

   UDP-Lite fragments packets into IP packets, constrained by the
   maximum size of IP packet.

   UDP-Lite changes the semantics of the UDP "payload length" field to
   that of a "checksum coverage length" field.  Otherwise, UDP-Lite is
   semantically identical to UDP.  Applications using UDP-Lite therefore
   can not make assumptions regarding the correctness of the data
   received in the insensitive part of the UDP-Lite payload.

   As for UDP, mechanisms for receiver flow control, congestion control,
   PMTU or PLPMTU discovery, support for ECN, etc need to be provided by
   upper layer protocols [RFC5405].

   Examples of use include a class of applications that can derive
   benefit from having partially-damaged payloads delivered, rather than
   discarded.  One use is to support error tolerate payload corruption
   when used over paths that include error-prone links, another
   application is when header integrity checks are required, but payload
   integrity is provided by some other mechanism (e.g.  [RFC6936].

   A UDP-Lite service may support IPv4 broadcast, multicast, anycast and
   unicast.

3.5.2.  Interface Description

   There is no current API specified in the RFC Series, but guidance on
   use of common APIs is provided in [RFC5405].

   The interface of UDP-Lite differs from that of UDP by the addition of
   a single (socket) option that communicates a checksum coverage length
   value: at the sender, this specifies the intended checksum coverage,
   with the remaining unprotected part of the payload called the "error-
   insensitive part".  The checksum coverage may also be made visible to
   the application via the UDP-Lite MIB module [RFC5097].

3.5.3.  Transport Protocol Components

   The transport protocol components provided by UDP-Lite are:

   o  unicast

   o  IPv4 broadcast, multicast and anycast

   o  port multiplexing

   o  non-reliable, non-ordered delivery

   o  message-oriented delivery

   o  partial integrity protection

3.6.  Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)

   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340] is an IETF
   standards track bidirectional transport protocol that provides
   unicast connections of congestion-controlled unreliable messages.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Gorry Fairhurst signed up as a contributor for this
   section.]

   The DCCP Problem Statement describes the goals that DCCP sought to
   address [RFC4336].  It is suitable for applications that transfer
   fairly large amounts of data and that can benefit from control over
   the trade off between timeliness and reliability [RFC4336].

   It offers low overhead, and many characteristics common to UDP, but
   can avoid "Re-inventing the wheel" each time a new multimedia
   application emerges.  Specifically it includes core functions
   (feature negotiation, path state management, RTT calculation, PMTUD,
   etc): This allows applications to use a compatible method defining
   how they send packets and where suitable to choose common algorithms

   to manage their functions.  Examples of suitable applications include
   interactive applications, streaming media or on-line games [RFC4336].

3.6.1.  Protocol Description

   DCCP is a connection-oriented datagram protocol, providing a three
   way handshake to allow a client and server to set up a connection,
   and mechanisms for orderly completion and immediate teardown of a
   connection.  The protocol is defined by a family of RFCs.

   It provides multiplexing to multiple sockets on each host using port
   numbers.  An active DCCP session is identified by its four-tuple of
   local and remote IP addresses and local port and remote port numbers.
   At connection setup, DCCP also exchanges the the service code
   [RFC5595] mechanism to allow transport instantiations to indicate the
   service treatment that is expected from the network.

   The protocol segments data into messages, typically sized to fit in
   IP packets, but which may be fragmented providing they are less than
   the A DCCP interface MAY allow applications to request fragmentation
   for packets larger than PMTU, but not larger than the maximum packet
   size allowed by the current congestion control mechanism (CCMPS)
   [RFC4340].

   Each message is identified by a sequence number.  The sequence number
   is used to identify segments in acknowledgments, to detect
   unacknowledged segments, to measure RTT, etc.  The protocol may
   support ordered or unordered delivery of data, and does not itself
   provide retransmission.  There is a Data Checksum option, which
   contains a strong CRC, lets endpoints detect application data
   corruption.  It also supports reduced checksum coverage, a partial
   integrity mechanisms similar to UDP-lIte.

   Receiver flow control is supported: limiting the amount of
   unacknowledged data that can be outstanding at a given time.

   A DCCP protocol instance can be extended [RFC4340] and tuned.  Some
   features are sender-side only, requiring no negotiation with the
   receiver; some are receiver-side only, some are explicitly negotiated
   during connection setup.

   DCCP supports negotiation of the congestion control profile, to
   provide Plug and Play congestion control mechanisms.  examples of
   specified profiles include [RFC4341] [RFC4342] [RFC5662].  All IETF-
   defined methods provide Congestion Control.

   DCCP use a Connect packet to start a session, and permits half-
   connections that allow each client to choose features it wishes to

   support.  Simultaneous open [RFC5596], as in TCP, can enable
   interoperability in the presence of middleboxes.  The Connect packet
   includes a Service Code field [RFC5595] designed to allow middle
   boxes and endpoints to identify the characteristics required by a
   session.  A lightweight UDP-based encapsulation (DCCP-UDP) has been
   defined [RFC6773] that permits DCCP to be used over paths where it is
   not natively supported.  Support in NAPT/NATs is defined in [RFC4340]
   and [RFC5595].

   Upper layer protocols specified on top of DCCP include: DTLS
   [RFC5595], RTP [RFC5672], ICE/SDP [RFC6773].

   A DCCP service is unicast.

   A common packet format has allowed tools to evolve that can read and
   interpret DCCP packets (e.g.  Wireshark).

3.6.2.  Interface Description

   API characteristics include: - Datagram transmission.  - Notification
   of the current maximum packet size.  - Send and reception of zero-
   length payloads.  - Set the Slow Receiver flow control at a receiver.
   - Detect a Slow receiver at the sender.

   There is no current API specified in the RFC Series.

3.6.3.  Transport Protocol Components

   The transport protocol components provided by DCCP are:

   o  unicast

   o  connection setup with feature negotiation and application-to-port
      mapping

   o  Service Codes

   o  port multiplexing

   o  non-reliable, ordered delivery

   o  flow control (slow receiver function)

   o  drop notification

   o  timestamps

   o  message-oriented delivery

   o  partial integrity protection

3.7.  Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP)

   RTP provides an end-to-end network transport service, suitable for
   applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or
   data, over multicast or unicast network services, including TCP, UDP,
   UDP-Lite, DCCP.
